"""The 9 directional laws + 3 gates — computed from the M2 feature matrix. 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Computes the 12 law/gate STATES (the schema `law` block) from the normalized market
features, exactly per THE_TRADING_CODE.md / SOW-D4. Directional laws emit -1 (sell
context) / 0 (inactive) / +1 (buy context); gates emit 0 (closed) / 1 (open).
Vectorized over the whole matrix (offline precompute) and per-row (live).

The 9 directional laws (3 families x 3):
  Super Trend: Bollinger / CCI / Shifted-SMA   (strongest expansion; continuation only)
  Trend:       Bollinger / CCI / Shifted-SMA   (directional structure; one side legal)
  Pull Back:   Bollinger / CCI / Shifted-SMA   (retrace inside HTF direction; that side only)
The 3 gates (non-directional): ATR Liquidity · Spread Filter · Stationarity Regime.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
Laws are the bot's SPINE. They run BEFORE the policy and define what is legal; the
mask (mask_engine) then forbids the wrong direction with logit -1e9. A clean law
state saves the bot from directional stupidity that would breach the 4% wall — the
single biggest source of avoidable breaches. Laws are NEVER reward terms (SOW R5).

4H OBSERVATION RULE 🔴: no law reads 4H to activate. 4H is context only. Every law
binds exactly the timeframes written in THE_TRADING_CODE.md (1m/5m/30m as specified).

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (Term 2 Law Context). Before blaming
the actor for a "bad" action, verify what was LEGAL here: a directional law in +1
bans OPEN_SHORT; in -1 bans OPEN_LONG. If a law flag looks wrong, the break is in its
INGREDIENT (the market feature), not the actor. These states are deterministic from
price — identical across seeds — so a law-state difference across runs is a data bug.

# [2026-06-13] M3 — implemented the 9 laws + 3 gates.
#   I: The bot had no spine — nothing defined which directions were legal, so a
#      policy could open straight into the 4% wall.
#   R: THE_TRADING_CODE.md (9 laws + 3 gates, exact TFs/params, SOW-D4); laws are
#      masks never rewards; 4H observed-never-required.
#   A: Vectorized compute_law_states reading the M2 features -> -1/0/+1 directional
#      states + 0/1 gates, in schema law-block order; deterministic from price.
#   C: The legal space is now defined exactly per the blueprint, so the mask can
#      forbid breach-bound directions before the policy ever acts — the foundation
#      of not breaching, which is the foundation of passing.
