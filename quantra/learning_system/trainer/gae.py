"""GAE — Generalized Advantage Estimation with the LOCKED gamma=0.997, lambda=0.97. 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Computes advantages + value targets from a rollout (rewards, V(s), dones, bootstrap
V(s_T)) using GAE with the hand-locked discount/trace. gamma=0.997 and lambda=0.97 are
the "math of patience" (REWARD_DESIGN.md / G2) and are NEVER tuned (off-limits to HPO).

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
High gamma + high lambda is what teaches the critic (and thus the actor) to value the
distant payoff of holding a good trade and respecting the wall, rather than reacting
bar-to-bar. That patience is the temperament that hits the daily target without
breaching — i.e. that passes consistently.

🔴 LOCKED: gamma=0.997, lambda=0.97. Changing them needs Monty's approval.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (Term 5 Value Estimate). Advantages
that don't go negative as the bot approaches the wall are a Critic Misalignment signal
— the GAE is correct; the value head learned the wrong thing.

# [2026-06-13] M8 — implemented GAE with the locked gamma/lambda.
#   I: PPO needs advantages + value targets, computed with the patience discount.
#   R: G2 (gamma=0.997, lambda=0.97 hand-locked, off-limits to HPO) + episode-boundary cuts.
#   A: compute_gae backward pass with done-masking; gamma/lambda as locked defaults.
#   C: The critic learns long-horizon value so the bot holds winners and respects the
#      wall - the patience that turns exploration into consistent passing.
