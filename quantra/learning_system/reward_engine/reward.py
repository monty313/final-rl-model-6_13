"""RewardEngine — layered reward L0-L6 + QUAD, with Layer-0 dominance (E8). 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Computes the layered reward (REWARD_DESIGN.md):
    r(t) = L0_dNetPnL + (a*L1_momentum - b*L2_stagnation + e*L4_target) * L5_category
           - d*L3_painzone   [+ L6 daily bonus at end of day]
Layer 0 (net PnL after costs) is the dominant driver; the shaping layers are tiny
"whispers" (small coefficients) that help timing/restraint without ever winning the
reward game while losing the trading game (the E8 rule). The QUAD daily bonus (E9)
sits on L6 with a hard 95%-of-day-PnL ceiling so it stays strictly < Layer 0.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
This is the objective the policy optimizes. Because L0 dominates, the bot is driven
to make real net money inside the legal/risk-safe space — not to game a shaper. L3's
exponential pain-zone ramp pushes it off the wall; L1/L2 sharpen entry/exit timing;
L6/QUAD reward consistent pass-days. Get this right and PPO learns to pass.

🔴 LOCKED: L0 dominance (E8), pain-zone exponential 3.5->4.0%, QUAD 95% ceiling.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (Term 7 Reward Decomposition).
``decompose()`` returns every layer's contribution — if any single shaping layer's
cumulative magnitude exceeds Layer 0 over a window, that is a Reward Hijack; cite the
per-layer integral. The reward is the training signal's ground truth.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] M6 — implemented the layered reward + QUAD bonus.
#   I: The env returned a raw Layer-0 proxy; the bot needs the full layered objective
#      with Layer-0 dominance and the pain-zone/QUAD structure to learn to PASS.
#   R: REWARD_DESIGN.md (L0-L6, tiny shaping, exponential pain 3.5->4.0%) + E8 (L0
#      dominates) + E9 (QUAD: 3 payable + TD qualifier, 5/5/5%, 95% ceiling, toggle).
#   A: RewardEngine.decompose/reward with tiny locked coefficients + L5 breach-risk
#      damping; QuadBonus EOD subsystem (SMA-4 vs shift-4 signals, flow streak, 95% cap).
#   C: Layer 0 provably dominates (E8 test), so the policy optimizes REAL net progress
#      inside the legal/risk-safe space and the pain ramp keeps it off the wall - which
#      is what passing consistently requires.
# [2026-06-15c] Clamp L4 target-progress at 1.0.
#   I: (audit) L4 = EPS*day_progress was unbounded; ftmo-OFF day_progress can reach ~40, so the
#      whisper could rival L0 over a window and the E8 proof never sampled that range.
#   R: Logic audit 2026-06-15 (L0 dominance must hold in ALL reachable configs).
#   A: l4 = EPS*min(1.0, max(0.0, day_progress)) — caps the shaping at target in every mode.
#   C: L0 stays the dominant objective even in the new OFF configuration, so the bot keeps
#      optimizing REAL net money (no reward hijack) - the basis of consistent passing.
