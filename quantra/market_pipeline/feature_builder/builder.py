"""FeatureBuilder — assemble the ~145-scalar observation; precompute market block offline.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Turns clean 1m bars into the policy's observation:
  1. resample to 5m/30m/4H (lookahead-safe, M1),
  2. compute the locked indicators per timeframe (indicators.py),
  3. as-of merge higher-TF features onto the 1m clock (closed bars only),
  4. assemble the precomputed block in canonical schema order (normalized `market`
     89 + RAW `market_raw` 30 = 119 with raw inputs on),
  5. clean (inf/NaN -> 0); clip ONLY the normalized block (RAW levels pass through
     for the M5 agent to standardize),
  6. cache the result to a float32 memmap so the RL loop never recomputes it.

The action-DEPENDENT blocks (law flags, per-slot trade ×5, portfolio, account) are
filled at env-step time (M3/M4); ``assemble_state`` concatenates everything into the
full 146-vector in schema order.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
The 89 market features are a pure function of price, so computing them ONCE offline
(not every step) is the single biggest training-speed win — it makes many
walk-forward windows × 7 seeds affordable (the user's cost mandate) and keeps the
hot loop to array-indexing + a microsecond MLP. Bounded, NaN-free inputs keep the
tiny 3×256 trunk stable so it can actually learn the breach-risk vs safe distinction
that passing depends on.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. The observation you analyse comes
from here. If hidden states can't separate regimes (Representation Collapse), check
``valid_from`` (warmup) and whether the market block is constant/zeroed for the
episode window before blaming the trunk. Features are clipped to ±CLIP; a feature
pinned at ±CLIP across an episode is a saturation signal worth flagging.

# UPDATE LOG (IRAC) - standing rule since 2026-06-13.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] M2 — FeatureBuilder + offline market precompute.
#   I: Computing ~89 multi-TF indicators every RL step would make walk-forward
#      validation unaffordable, and any lookahead/NaN would teach a fantasy edge
#      or destabilise the tiny MLP — both wreck consistent passing.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md (~145, 4H observation copies) + offline-precompute design +
#      lookahead-safe as-of merge (M1) + bounded encodings.
#   A: Vectorized per-TF compute -> backward as-of merge -> schema-ordered 89-wide
#      matrix -> inf/NaN->0, clip ±10 -> float32 memmap cache; assemble_state()
#      concatenates the full 146 with asserted block widths.
#   C: The hot loop is just array indexing + a microsecond MLP on a faithful,
#      bounded, lookahead-free observation, so we can afford the seeds/windows that
#      prove a real, transferable FTMO pass rate.
# [2026-06-13] Operator override — compute the RAW SMA + RAW CCI block.
#   I: The operator wants raw (unnormalized) SMA + CCI levels added to the obs; raw
#      price clipped to ±10 would be destroyed, and unbounded inputs can destabilise
#      the small MLP or invite shortcut learning if fed naively.
#   R: Operator directive overrides the no-raw-price rule for `market_raw`; raw
#      features bypass ±CLIP and are flagged (RAW_FEATURE_NAMES) for M5 standardization.
#   A: Added raw SMA (5m/30m/4H) + raw CCI (CCI TFs); ordered by PRECOMPUTED_NAMES;
#      clip applied ONLY to normalized columns; assemble_state now takes the 119-wide
#      precomputed row; valid_from still keys off non-4H NORMALIZED features.
#   C: The policy gets the requested raw signal without corrupting it, while the raw
#      block stays isolated + flagged so we can standardize/ablate it — protecting
#      training stability and the pass rate if raw inputs turn out to hurt.
