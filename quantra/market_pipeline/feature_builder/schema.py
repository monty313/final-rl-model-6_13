"""StateVectorSchema — the canonical, ordered layout of the observation vector.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Defines EXACTLY which scalars the policy sees, in what order, grouped into named
blocks, so the total width is fixed and asserted everywhere. This is the contract
the FeatureBuilder fills, the env assembles, the PPO trunk consumes, and the
TelemetryLogger labels (the data contract requires "grouped feature block names").

Block widths (default INCLUDE_RAW_INPUTS=True -> total 179):
    market      92   normalized market+time + 3 gate ingredients (precomputed)
    market_raw  30   RAW SMA + RAW CCI inputs (operator-directed; precomputed)
    law         12   9 laws + 3 gates (filled by LawMask, M3)
    trade x5    35   7 features x 5 slots (env, M4)
    portfolio    3   aggregates across slots (env, M4)
    account      7   equity/buffers + 2 challenge-progress (env, M4)
    ------------------
    TOTAL      179   (149 when INCLUDE_RAW_INPUTS=False)

The first TWO blocks (market + market_raw = 122) are action-independent and are the
FeatureBuilder's precomputed output (``PRECOMPUTED_NAMES`` / ``PRECOMPUTED_DIM``).

OPERATOR OVERRIDE [2026-06-13]
-----------------------------
``market_raw`` holds RAW indicator levels (SMA period 1 shift 0-3, SMA 30/50 on
5m/30m/4H; raw CCI 10/30/100 on 1m/5m/30m/4H). This is an operator-directed addition
that intentionally departs from STATE_VECTOR.md's "never feed raw prices" encoding
rule. Risks + the required safeguard (input standardization in the agent) are written
in ``RAW_INPUTS.md`` and flagged via ``RAW_FEATURE_NAMES`` so the M5 agent standardizes
them. Toggle with ``quantra.runtime.config.INCLUDE_RAW_INPUTS``.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
A frozen, named, asserted observation guarantees the bot always sees the full
FTMO-relevant picture and that telemetry can map any neuron to its driving feature
(MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER Term 1) — the precondition for diagnosable, repeatable
passing. The raw block is delineated + flagged so the LLM can tell whether a
pass-rate problem traces to an unnormalized input (shortcut learning / instability)
versus the policy itself.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. Use ``block_slice(name)`` /
``FEATURE_NAMES`` to know which observation indices belong to which block. The
``market_raw`` indices are UNNORMALIZED — if you see Representation Chaos or
Shortcut Learning, check whether a raw feature is dominating (large magnitude,
single-feature attribution) before blaming the trunk; the prescription is usually
"standardize the raw block / re-fit input stats", not a trunk change.

# UPDATE LOG (IRAC) - standing rule since 2026-06-13.
# Every change to this file APPENDS a dated IRAC entry below (newest last):
#   I (Issue) / R (Rule) / A (Application) / C (Conclusion -> why this makes the
#   bot pass FTMO MORE CONSISTENTLY, with no bug or inefficiency). Rulebook:
#   docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] M2 — canonical state-vector schema created.
#   I: The bot's perception had no single, asserted layout; a later refactor could
#      drop/reorder a challenge-critical feature and silently blind the policy to
#      breach-risk — a top cause of inconsistent passing.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md block counts (~145) + the telemetry data contract.
#   A: Defined 146 scalars in 5 ordered blocks with unique-name validation.
#   C: A frozen, named, asserted observation means the bot always sees the full FTMO
#      picture and telemetry can map any neuron to its feature.
# [2026-06-13] Operator override — added RAW SMA + RAW CCI block (market_raw).
#   I: The operator wants raw SMA (sma1 sh0-3, sma30/50 on 5m/30m/4H) and raw CCI
#      (10/30/100 on 1m/5m/30m/4H) added ALONGSIDE the normalized features, to give
#      the policy un-transformed level signals. This departs from the no-raw-price rule.
#   R: Operator directive (2026-06-13) overrides STATE_VECTOR.md encoding for this
#      block; raw inputs flagged so the M5 agent standardizes them (RAW_INPUTS.md).
#   A: Added the 30-feature `market_raw` block (gated by config.INCLUDE_RAW_INPUTS),
#      RAW_FEATURE_NAMES (bypass clip + mark for standardization), PRECOMPUTED_NAMES
#      (market+market_raw=119); STATE_DIM 146->176. Snapshot guard + impact tool track drift.
#   C: The policy gains the requested raw signals while the raw block stays isolated,
#      flagged, and toggleable — so we can ablate raw-vs-normalized on the scoreboard
#      and, if raw inputs hurt pass-rate or stability, disable them without touching
#      the rest of the perception. Net: more signal to try, with a clean off-ramp that
#      protects consistent passing.
# [2026-06-13] M3 — added gate ingredients (spread x2, adf) to the market block.
#   I: The Spread Filter + Stationarity gates were in the law block but their
#      INGREDIENTS (spread vs ATR/range, ADF stat) weren't observable — violating the
#      law-ingredient coverage rule, so the bot couldn't see WHY a gate opened/closed.
#   R: Law-ingredient coverage rule [M] + F4 (rolling ADF 100-bar p<0.05).
#   A: Added spread_atr_1m, spread_range_ratio_1m, adf_stat_1m to `market` (89->92);
#      STATE_DIM 176->179. Snapshot guard flags the drift (re-pinned via --update).
#   C: Every gate's ingredients are now observable, so the bot learns gate-aware
#      behaviour (trade only in live/stationary regimes) instead of treating gates as
#      opaque on/off — fewer dead-market/illiquid trades that erode the pass rate.
