"""LawMask engine — law states -> action mask (logit -1e9 on forbidden). 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Turns the 12 law/gate states (laws.py) plus the current position + slot occupancy
into the additive direction mask over {HOLD, OPEN_LONG, OPEN_SHORT, CLOSE} and the
pointer mask over the 5 slots. Forbidden actions get -1e9 so the policy can never
sample them. Supports BOTH enforcement modes:

  LIVE  — laws BAN directions (an active buy-law forbids OPEN_SHORT, etc.); gates ban
          NEW opens when closed. Everything else is legal.
  SCHOOL— curriculum permission mode: OPEN is allowed ONLY in the direction the
          stage's required law(s) currently permit, and only when active.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
This is the hard gate that mechanically prevents directional breaches: the policy
cannot trade against the trend a law defines, and cannot open in dead/illiquid/
wrong-regime conditions. The SAME masks run in training and live, so the discipline
the bot learns transfers to passing real challenges. HOLD is never masked, so a legal
action always exists.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. Always interpret the action
distribution against this mask (Term 4): a 0.95 probability is meaningless if it was
the only legal option. Mask Dependence = the pre-mask logits repeatedly favor an
action this engine forbids; that's an actor problem, not a mask problem. The mask
itself is correct by construction (tested). Never modify masks/sizing/walls.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] M3 — implemented the action-mask engine (both enforcement modes).
#   I: Law states existed but nothing converted them into the -1e9 action mask, and
#      nothing enforced the live-ban vs law-school-permission distinction.
#   R: SOW C5 (logit -1e9), §2.3-2.4 (position/slot legality), THE_TRADING_CODE.md
#      two-mode rule; HOLD always legal; gates ban new opens only.
#   A: build_direction_mask (base legality -> slots -> gates -> laws, live or school)
#      + build_pointer_mask (occupied slots only) + LawMask wrapper.
#   C: Breach-bound and out-of-context directions are now mechanically impossible to
#      sample, in both training and live, so the discipline transfers and the bot
#      stops losing challenges to directional/regime mistakes.
