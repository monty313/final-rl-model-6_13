"""WalkForwardRunner + PromotionGate — the single locked validation protocol. 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
WalkForwardRunner generates the locked walk-forward windows — **12 months train / 2
months test / 1 month step** — and orchestrates **7 seeds** per window (SOW §8.1 / I2).
PromotionGate enforces the promotion rule (I3): a candidate promotes only if it
survives the full walk-forward on **>= 3 of the 7 seeds**, shows a scoreboard
improvement vs the previous checkpoint, AND has **no worse breach count**.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
Walk-forward on rolling out-of-sample windows x 7 seeds is what distinguishes a brain
that genuinely PASSES from one that overfit a lucky window/seed. The promotion gate
then refuses to ship anything that isn't a robust improvement with no extra breaches —
so the deployed brain's pass rate only ever ratchets up.

🔴 LOCKED: 12/2/1 months, 7 seeds, and the promotion conditions.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. A candidate that passes few seeds is
Shortcut Learning until proven otherwise (overfit to a seed/window). Cite the seed
pass count.

# [2026-06-13] M12 — implemented WalkForwardRunner + PromotionGate.
#   I: Nothing validated robustness across out-of-sample windows/seeds or gated promotion.
#   R: SOW §8.1/I2 (12/2/1 months, 7 seeds) + I3 (>=3 seeds + improvement + no worse breach).
#   A: generate_windows (rolling 12/2/1), WalkForwardRunner.run (window x seed -> RunResult),
#      PromotionGate.promote enforcing all three I3 conditions.
#   C: Only brains that genuinely + robustly pass more (with no extra breaches) ever ship,
#      so the deployed pass rate only ratchets up - the definition of repeatable passing.
