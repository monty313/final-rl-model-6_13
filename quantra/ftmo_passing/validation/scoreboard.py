"""Scoreboard — the ONLY ranking that matters. 🔴

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Ranks runs strictly by the locked scoreboard hierarchy (SOW §1.3 / I1):
  1. FTMO pass rate          (higher better)
  2. Breach count            (lower better)
  3. Target-hit consistency  (higher better)
  4. Max drawdown path       (lower better)
Raw PnL is NEVER a ranking criterion — it is a diagnostic sanity check only.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
Selecting brains by pass-rate (not profit) is THE mechanism that keeps the whole
project pointed at the mission. A bot that makes more money but breaches more, or
passes once luckily, ranks BELOW a steadier passer. This is what makes "repeatedly
pass" the optimization target rather than PnL.

🔴 LOCKED ranking order. PnL may not enter the key.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (Term 8 Outcome). Cite scoreboard
metrics as pure facts in the "What happened" section; never rank by PnL.

# [2026-06-13] M12 — implemented the Scoreboard.
#   I: Nothing ranked runs by the mission metric; PnL could sneak in as a selector.
#   R: SOW §1.3/I1 (pass-rate -> breach -> consistency -> max-DD; PnL diagnostic only).
#   A: RunResult + Scoreboard metrics + lexicographic rank_key (PnL excluded) + better_than.
#   C: Brains are selected for REPEATED PASSING, not profit - the single choice that keeps
#      the whole system optimizing the mission.
