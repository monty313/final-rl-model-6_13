"""Quantra runtime configuration — the single source of runtime knobs.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Holds the runtime-memory inputs and infrastructure constants Quantra needs at
launch: the FTMO challenge defaults, the four traded symbols, the Google-Drive
file IDs for the price data, filesystem paths, and the hardware-utilisation
targets used by the rest of ``quantra.runtime``.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
Per SOW Section 1.4 the policy is *account-size-blind* and takes its targets as
**pure runtime memory** (no saved config file dictating strategy). This module is
that runtime memory: ``daily_target_pct`` (2.5) and ``daily_risk_pct`` (4.0) are
the very constraints the bot is being trained to respect on every window. Keeping
them here — never hardcoded inside laws, rewards, or the env — is what lets the
same brain be pointed at a different target/loss pair without retraining, which is
the whole point of "repeatedly pass FTMO-style challenges over time".

The hardware section exists so training cycles are cheap and fast: we want to
*finish* walk-forward windows, not burn paid GPU hours on a tiny MLP. Faster,
cheaper iterations = more seeds, more windows, a better-validated pass rate.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Binding rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. If you (the Risk Doctor)
see a diagnosis that depends on the daily target / loss / account size, read those
values FROM the telemetry packet's run-config block, NOT from this file — at
inference the operator may have passed different runtime values. This file only
provides the *defaults* (SOW-A3) and the immutable infrastructure constants.

# Every change to this file APPENDS a dated IRAC entry below (newest last):
#   I (Issue) / R (Rule) / A (Application) / C (Conclusion -> why this makes the
#   bot pass FTMO MORE CONSISTENTLY, with no bug or inefficiency). The LLM Risk
#   Doctor reads this log to reconstruct the chronological 'why' when
#   triangulating a pass-rate regression. Rulebook: docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] Runtime config documented + pinned by the master suite.
#   I: FTMO target/loss defaults, Drive file IDs and paths had no change-log or test pin.
#   R: SOW-A3 (2.5%/4.0% configurable, never hardcoded strategy) + the new IRAC rule.
#   A: Annotated every constant for its FTMO role; defaults now asserted in the master suite (Section A).
#   C: The bot always trains/judges against the real 2.5%/4% walls, so a 'pass' is reproducible and meaningful.
# [2026-06-13] nominal_state_dim 145 -> 146 to match the M2 schema.
#   I: The benchmark's nominal width (145) no longer matched the real observation
#      width once M2 fixed the canonical layout at 146.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md (~145) realised as schema.STATE_DIM = 146; keep config import-cycle-free.
#   A: Set nominal_state_dim = 146; the master suite now asserts config == schema.
#   C: The hardware race times the true observation width, so the device/cost choice
#      reflects the real workload — no wasted GPU spend, faster path to a validated pass rate.
# [2026-06-13] nominal_state_dim -> 179/149 (M3 gate ingredients) + added POINT_SIZE.
#   I: M3 added 3 gate-ingredient features (176->179); and the Spread Filter needs a
#      points->price conversion the config didn't provide.
#   R: Law-ingredient coverage (spread, ADF) + SOW-H2 realistic spread costs.
#   A: Bumped nominal_state_dim to 179 (raw on)/149 (off); added per-symbol POINT_SIZE.
#   C: config stays in lockstep with the schema and the bot sees real spread friction,
#      so it learns to avoid illiquid/dead-market trades that quietly erode pass-rate.
# [2026-06-13] M4 — added contract specs + CostConfig + RiskConfig + slippage.
#   I: The env/RiskManager/CostLayer need per-symbol contract sizes, real FTMO costs,
#      and risk dials to size and cost trades in account dollars.
#   R: SOW §10.5 ($5 RT/lot forex; metals/indices no commission; spread+slippage) +
#      H3 (raw_size -> lots vs remaining buffer) + C8 (no costless world).
#   A: Added CONTRACT_SIZE, SLIPPAGE_POINTS, CostConfig ($5 RT forex-only), RiskConfig
#      (stop_atr_mult, lot_step, min/max lot, per-trade risk cap).
#   C: Trades are sized + costed in the same dollars as the 4% wall, so the
#      no-overshoot invariant is enforceable and the learned edge survives real fees —
#      both prerequisites for passing rather than looking profitable.
# [2026-06-13] nominal_state_dim -> 167 (CCI un-normalized).
#   I: CCI raw decision removed the duplicate raw_cci block (179->167); the benchmark
#      width must track the schema.
#   R: COUPLING - config.nominal_state_dim must equal schema.STATE_DIM (master-suite asserted).
#   A: 167 (raw inputs on) / 149 (off).
#   C: The hardware race times the true observation width, so the device/cost choice stays honest.
# [2026-06-15] nominal_state_dim -> 185 (raw Bollinger band levels added).
#   I: Operator kept BOTH normalized + raw Bollinger; market 92->110, STATE_DIM 167->185.
#   R: COUPLING [C1] - nominal_state_dim must equal schema.STATE_DIM (master-suite asserted).
#   A: 185 (raw inputs on) / 167 (off).
#   C: The benchmark + device choice stay aligned with the real observation width.
# [2026-06-15] Per-day inputs: leverage + make_challenge() + mode bounds.
#   I: Daily target/trailing-stop weren't per-day settable, ftmo_mode was a dead flag,
#      and there was no leverage/margin input (operator uses 1:50..1:2000 accounts).
#   R: Operator decision 2026-06-15 (adjustable target/risk/leverage per day; ftmo OFF
#      unlocks the wide side-account envelope; % space so one brain scales by proportion).
#   A: Added ChallengeConfig.leverage; FTMO_ON/OFF_BOUNDS + LEVERAGE_CHOICES; make_challenge()
#      clamps target/risk to the mode bounds and pins wall+pain-zone to the trailing input.
#   C: The operator can dial each account's target/stop/leverage and the bot trades the same
#      normalized policy against it - consistent passing on the priority, safe scale when off.
# [2026-06-15b] Added stop_for_day toggle (OFF mode).
#   I: OFF still needs a target (the aim) but the operator may want to bank+stop at it.
#   R: Operator correction 2026-06-15.
#   A: ChallengeConfig.stop_for_day + make_challenge passthrough.
#   C: OFF can either run past the target (default) or bank a side-account day on demand.
