"""The hardware auto-optimizer — one call that picks device + parallelism.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
``plan()`` races CPU vs GPU on a representative workload, applies the user's
"prefer CPU / don't waste GPU money" policy, sizes vectorised-env parallelism to
~80% of the winner, pins thread counts, and returns a ``HardwarePlan`` that the
trainer consumes. ``print_report()`` renders the decision for the operator.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
This is the module that fulfils the operator's instruction: train as fast and
cheap as possible by using ~80% of whichever device is genuinely faster. Faster,
cheaper rollouts -> more seeds and walk-forward windows validated -> a more
trustworthy FTMO pass rate, which is the only scoreboard that matters.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. The HardwarePlan is pure
infrastructure. It changes how *fast* training runs, never *what* it learns. When
diagnosing pass/breach behaviour, ignore device/n_envs — they are not in the
causal chain (State Vector -> Law -> Hidden State -> Heads -> Risk -> Reward ->
Outcome). Treat this only as context for runtime/cost questions.

#   I (Issue) / R (Rule) / A (Application) / C (Conclusion -> why this makes the
#   bot pass FTMO MORE CONSISTENTLY, with no bug or inefficiency). The LLM Risk
#   Doctor reads this log to reconstruct the chronological 'why' when
#   triangulating a pass-rate regression. Rulebook: docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] One call: race -> prefer-CPU -> scale -> report.
#   I: Choosing a device blindly either wastes GPU money or starves throughput.
#   R: Prefer CPU unless a GPU is >=1.30x faster; ~80% autoscale; infra is outside the learning causal chain.
#   A: race_devices -> _pick_device policy -> autoscale -> thread pin -> print_report.
#   C: The cheapest fast substrate -> more seeds/windows -> a more trustworthy FTMO pass rate.
