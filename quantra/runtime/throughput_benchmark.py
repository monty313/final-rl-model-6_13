"""Startup throughput race: measure real steps/sec per device, pick the winner.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Runs a short, representative PPO-style workload (batched forward over a vectorised
rollout + a backward/optimizer step on the four-head 3x256 net) on each available
device for a fixed wall-time budget, and reports throughput in
*environment-steps per second*. The optimizer uses these numbers to choose the
device honestly instead of assuming a GPU is faster.

HOW IT SERVES REPEATED FTMO-STYLE PASSING
-----------------------------------------
For a ~145-input 3x256 MLP the GPU's compute advantage is usually swamped by
host<->device transfer overhead and the env step (numpy) cost. Measuring this up
front prevents the classic waste: renting a Colab GPU that then sits ~5% utilised
while CPU env-stepping bottlenecks the run. Cheaper, faster iterations -> more
seeds and windows validated per dollar -> a more trustworthy pass rate.

LLM RISK DOCTOR — HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
Rulebook: ``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md``. The benchmark result is an
infrastructure fact (steps/sec), never a learning signal. If a run is slow, this
file's numbers tell you whether the bottleneck is device or env — but slowness is
never a *failure-taxonomy* item. Do not classify throughput as Risk Blindness etc.
