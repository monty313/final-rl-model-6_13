"""QUANTRA MASTER TEST SUITE — the one big runnable test for the whole folder.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (read before adding tests)
-----------------------------------------------
STANDING RULE [2026-06-13]: this is the SINGLE place every Quantra test lives.
All future tests — for any milestone (laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry, ...) —
are APPENDED here under the matching section, never scattered into new files. One
command runs the entire folder's guarantees:

    pytest tests/test_ftmo_master_suite.py        # or just: pytest

WHAT IT PROVES (everything is judged against repeated FTMO passing, not PnL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The suite is organised along the interpretability chain from
``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (State Vector -> Law -> Hidden State ->
Heads -> Risk -> Reward -> Outcome), plus the cost/speed substrate that lets us
afford enough seeds and walk-forward windows to *establish* a pass rate:

    SECTION A  Runtime / hardware efficiency   (afford the validation budget)
    SECTION B  Data pipeline - loader          (faithful FTMO situation in)
    SECTION C  Data pipeline - resampler       (no lookahead -> edge transfers)
    (SECTION D+ added as M2+ land: features, laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry)

HOW THE LLM RISK DOCTOR SHOULD USE THIS FILE
--------------------------------------------
A green master suite means the *substrate* the bot trains on is faithful and fast;
it does NOT by itself prove the policy passes. When triangulating a pass-rate
regression, first confirm this suite is green — a red data/resampler test means the
bot's world is corrupt (e.g. lookahead leakage masquerading as a learned edge), and
that is the break, not the actor/critic. Only if the substrate is sound do you walk
the chain into hidden-state / reward / critic diagnostics.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# UPDATE LOG (IRAC) — standing rule since 2026-06-13.
# Every change APPENDS a dated IRAC entry (newest last). Conclusion is ALWAYS why
# the change makes the bot pass FTMO more consistently with no bug/inefficiency.
# Rulebook: docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] Created the single master suite (hardening pass).
#   I: Tests were split across test_runtime.py + test_data_pipeline.py; the operator
#      wanted ONE runnable suite, and future milestones risked fragmenting tests.
#   R: New standing rule — one master suite all future tests append to; every guard
#      framed against repeated FTMO passing (SOW Section 11 acceptance tests).
#   A: Consolidated all runtime + data-pipeline tests here under chain-ordered
#      sections (A runtime, B loader, C resampler); added efficiency/caching guards
#      (parquet-cache reuse, parse throughput); deleted the two old test files.
#   C: A single green command now proves the training substrate is faithful and
#      cheap, so we can afford the seeds/windows that establish a reproducible pass
#      rate — and the LLM can rule the substrate out first when triangulating.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section D - feature builder + state vector (M2).
#   I: The ~145-scalar observation needed proof it is complete (146), bounded,
#      signal-bearing, and lookahead-free before any policy trains on it.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md schema (146) + lookahead-safety + bounded-encoding design.
#   A: Added Section D - schema/block-width pins, config==schema, finite+clipped
#      matrix, signal-variance, truncated-vs-full no-lookahead, cyclical time,
#      assemble_state width+validation, valid_from warmup. 8 tests (23 total green).
#   C: The bot's world is now provably faithful and leak-free, so a learned edge is
#      real and transfers live - the precondition for repeatable FTMO passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section E - change-impact tracker + raw-input block tests.
#   I: An operator-added raw SMA/CCI block changed the observation (146->176); the
#      obs could later drift again undetected and silently degrade pass-rate.
#   R: Operator directives (raw inputs + a change-impact tracking system, LLM-readable).
#   A: Updated Section D to 176/raw-block coverage; added Section E - snapshot-match,
#      LLM-interpretation, AST dependency-graph, and FTMO-framed-report tests.
#   C: The observation is now both faithful AND change-guarded, so any future obs
#      change is caught with a concrete follow-up list before it can hurt passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section F - LawMask (M3) + gate ingredients (dim 176->179).
#   I: The bot needed its spine (which directions are legal) proven correct before
#      training, and the snapshot needed re-pinning after adding gate ingredients.
#   R: THE_TRADING_CODE.md (9 laws + 3 gates, exact params) + SOW C5 (-1e9) + §2.3-2.4
#      position/slot legality + the two enforcement modes.
#   A: Section F - law states per family (incl. CCI +100, ssma align, pullback desync),
#      3 gates, position/slot legality, live-ban vs school-permission, pointer mask,
#      end-to-end wrapper. Re-pinned the state-vector snapshot to 179.
#   C: The legal space is verified exactly per blueprint, so the mask mechanically
#      blocks breach-bound directions in both training and live - the foundation of
#      not breaching, which is the foundation of consistent passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section G - Env + RiskManager + CostLayer (M4).
#   I: The challenge physics (shared account, 5 slots, true-sequential risk, costs,
#      wall) needed proof that no risk/sizing rule can overshoot and that the loop is
#      faithful, before any policy trains on it.
#   R: SOW B5 (no collective overshoot) + H3 (sizing vs buffer) + §10.5 (costs) +
#      §2.4 (slots) + §2.7 (wall).
#   A: Section G - CostLayer (forex-only $5 RT, spread/slippage), RiskManager
#      no-overshoot (2000-case fuzz + refusal), B5 4-symbol one-bar invariant,
#      true-sequential buffer visibility, slot fill/mask/pointer-close, round-trip cost
#      bleed, hard-wall force-flatten, 179-dim obs + mask coercion. 12 tests.
#   C: The env is now provably faithful and overshoot-proof, so the behaviour the bot
#      learns here is the behaviour that passes real challenges - not a sim artifact.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section H - PPOAgent + RolloutBuffer + PPO loss (M5).
#   I: The brain that consumes the 179-dim obs and emits masked, sized, slot-aware
#      actions - plus the summed-log-prob PPO loss - needed building + proving.
#   R: PPO_ENGINE.md (3x256 trunk, 4 heads, Beta size, summed 3-head log-prob,
#      size-on-OPEN/pointer-on-CLOSE gating, -1e9 masks, live argmax/mean) + SOW §2.8/2.9.
#   A: Section H - locked architecture shape, mask-respecting sampling, the OPEN/CLOSE
#      log-prob gating, deterministic argmax/Beta-mean, 10-field buffer + no-replay,
#      PPO loss (ratio≈1/KL≈0 post-collection, grad reaches the trunk), agent-drives-env.
#   C: The policy provably cannot sample an illegal/breach-bound action and its update
#      is a correct trust-region step - so training under the M4 physics moves it toward
#      passing, not toward the wall.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section I - RewardEngine + QUAD + E8 (M6).
#   I: The objective needed Layer-0 dominance proven, plus the pain ramp and QUAD ceiling.
#   R: REWARD_DESIGN.md + E8 (L0 dominates) + E9 (QUAD 95% ceiling, pass-day gate).
#   A: Section I - E8 dominance over 1000 rollouts, pain-zone monotonicity, L0 whisper,
#      QUAD 95% ceiling + non-pass-day zero + streak reset, env-uses-engine. 6 tests.
#   C: The training signal provably can't be hijacked by a shaper, so PPO optimizes real
#      net progress inside the legal/risk-safe space - the objective that passes.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section J - curriculum + two-phase episode (M7).
#   I: The +2.5% win needed banking behind a tight wall, and training needed staging.
#   R: SOW §2.6 (two-phase) + §7 (law-gated curriculum, structure-first).
#   A: Section J - phase-B wall tightening, env auto-flat+enter-phase-B at target,
#      stage configs + school mode, 1m-timing feature mask (law ingredients kept),
#      graduation to live. 5 tests.
#   C: The bot banks pass-days behind a 1% wall and learns law-respect by habit -
#      both push it toward consistent passing rather than reckless profit-chasing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section K - Trainer + GAE + scheduler + G8 (M8).
#   I: Nothing ran the on-policy PPO loop that turns the pieces into a trained brain.
#   R: SOW §2.1/2.8 (PPO), G2/G4 (locked gamma/lambda + ranges + 512/64), G8, §8.4.
#   A: Section K - GAE locked gamma/lambda + shapes, scheduler dials within ranges +
#      cooling, G8 multi-TF-agree/flat/>=1.5ATR, trainer-runs-updates-checkpoints. 5 tests.
#   C: Repeated patient PPO steps under faithful physics + masks produce a brain that
#      hits target without breaching, and every brain is saved for the promotion gate.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section L - TelemetryLogger round-trip (M9).
#   I: The diagnostics layer needed a versioned, complete, reconstructable record.
#   R: MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md data contract + versioned schema.
#   A: Section L - full-field round-trip (every contract field survives JSONL),
#      header carries schema version + grouped block names for the LLM. 2 tests.
#   C: Any breach/pass-day is fully reconstructable, so the Risk Doctor can diagnose
#      the cause - the loop that stops the same failure recurring and eroding pass-rate.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section M - MLPInterpreter 7 visuals (M10).
#   I: Telemetry arrays explain nothing without the standard visual evidence.
#   R: MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md REQUIRED VISUALS (the 7, tied to passing).
#   A: Section M - generate_all() writes all 7 PNGs from a telemetry run. 1 test.
#   C: Internal behaviour becomes inspectable evidence, so robust pass-behaviour is
#      distinguishable from fragile luck - protecting the pass rate.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section N - LLMRiskDoctor (M11).
#   I: The read-only/mandatory-rulebook boundary + taxonomy diagnosis needed enforcing.
#   R: MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md (template, 8 taxonomy, no 9th) + SOW R5/§9.3.
#   A: Section N - fail-loud without rulebook, no write/modify/execute methods,
#      Reward-Hijack classification with cited evidence + template render, never a 9th. 4 tests.
#   C: Failures get a true, evidence-backed cause + safe prescription before they cost a
#      challenge, and the doctor can never touch execution - it only protects passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section O - Scoreboard + walk-forward + promotion gate (M12).
#   I: Nothing ranked brains by pass-rate, validated out-of-sample, or gated promotion.
#   R: SOW §1.3/I1 (ranking) + I2 (12/2/1, 7 seeds) + I3 (>=3 seeds + improvement + no worse breach).
#   A: Section O - scoreboard ranks by pass-rate-not-PnL, 12/2/1 window generation,
#      runner over windows x seeds, promotion gate's 3 conditions. 4 tests.
#   C: Only robust, no-worse-breach improvements ship, so the deployed pass rate only
#      ratchets up - the operational definition of repeatable passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section P - HPO sacred-guard (M13).
#   I: Tuning was needed but a naive search could tune away the patience that passes.
#   R: SOW G6 (Optuna on non-sacred dials; gamma/lambda/scheduler hand-locked).
#   A: Section P - guard refuses sacred dials, suggest returns only non-sacred, tiny
#      Optuna study maximizes a pass-rate proxy with no sacred dial. 3 tests.
#   C: HPO improves tunable stability while the patience underpinning passing stays
#      locked - tuning can only help the pass rate, never sabotage it.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section Q - live bridge (M14).
#   I: Live execution + kill switches + diagnostics isolation needed building/proving.
#   R: SOW §2.10 (determinism) + B2 (5 slots/pointer-CLOSE) + §10.1 (kill switches) + C7 (isolation).
#   A: Section Q - adapter sim fallback, slot/pointer-close mechanics, manual-halt flatten+latch,
#      live-runner deterministic exec + breach auto-flat + halted-block, no-diagnostics-import. 5 tests.
#   C: The learned pass-behaviour reproduces live with identical masks/slots, behind two
#      hard kill switches - so passes get banked without a bad session blowing the account.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section R - end-to-end acceptance (M15). BUILD COMPLETE (M0-M15).
#   I: The 14 milestones needed proof they compose into one working mission machine.
#   R: SOW §11.3 (one run: scoreboard 4 metrics; telemetry -> 7 visuals; LLM diagnosis).
#   A: Section R - run_acceptance trains a brain, evals deterministically with full-
#      contract telemetry, emits the 7 visuals + a template diagnosis + the scoreboard. 1 test.
#   C: The whole chain runs green, so the system can be pointed at real bars + 7 seeds to
#      establish a real pass rate - the FTMO-passing machine is built and verifiable.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section S - production MT5 path (M14b).
#   I: M14's MT5 adapter couldn't close + had no live feed; it couldn't actually trade.
#   R: SOW §2.10/§10 (live determinism + kill switches) + C4 (1m) + no-lookahead.
#   A: Section S - MT5 close/order-send are real (source-verified, terminal-only), live
#      session builds the 179 obs from a bar stream + decides + breach-auto-flats. 3 tests.
#   C: A trained brain can now be driven on MT5 bar-by-bar with faithful obs/masks/slots
#      behind hard kill switches - the bridge from a trained brain to a banked live pass.
# [2026-06-15] Added Section T - per-day inputs + ftmo_mode + leverage/margin.
#   I: New per-day config injection, ftmo OFF single-trailing/no-autoflat, and the margin
#      ceiling needed locked-in proof.
#   R: Operator decision 2026-06-15 + B5 (no-overshoot must survive the new caps).
#   A: Section T - make_challenge defaults/clamps, OFF single-trailing + never-autoflat,
#      env.reset(challenge=) injection, margin caps lots, OFF removes per-trade cap. 6 tests.
#   C: The adjustable-input + margin behaviour is regression-proof, so the operator can dial
#      accounts per day with the no-overshoot guarantee intact.
# [2026-06-15] Added Section U - logic-audit fixes + consistency DEMONSTRATION.
#   I: The adversarial logic audit found a dominant-reward mis-attribution, a dead daily reset,
#      and an unbounded L4; the fixes needed locked-in proof + an end-to-end pass demonstration.
#   R: Logic audit 2026-06-15 (verified bugs) + the mission (2.5%/day, no 4% breach, consistently).
#   A: Section U - exact per-symbol PnL decomposition (US30 no longer absorbs others' PnL),
#      daily reset fires on a date change, and a 15-day demonstration: every day banks +2.5%,
#      0 breach the 4% wall, plus a losing-day protection check (loss capped at the wall). 5 tests.
#   C: The post-fix challenge LOGIC provably delivers consistent passing mechanics (banks the
#      target, never overshoots the wall) - the rails the trained policy needs to pass for real.
