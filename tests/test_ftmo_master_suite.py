"""QUANTRA MASTER TEST SUITE — the one big runnable test for the whole folder.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (read before adding tests)
-----------------------------------------------
STANDING RULE [2026-06-13]: this is the SINGLE place every Quantra test lives.
All future tests — for any milestone (laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry, ...) —
are APPENDED here under the matching section, never scattered into new files. One
command runs the entire folder's guarantees:

    pytest tests/test_ftmo_master_suite.py        # or just: pytest

WHAT IT PROVES (everything is judged against repeated FTMO passing, not PnL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The suite is organised along the interpretability chain from
``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (State Vector -> Law -> Hidden State ->
Heads -> Risk -> Reward -> Outcome), plus the cost/speed substrate that lets us
afford enough seeds and walk-forward windows to *establish* a pass rate:

    SECTION A  Runtime / hardware efficiency   (afford the validation budget)
    SECTION B  Data pipeline - loader          (faithful FTMO situation in)
    SECTION C  Data pipeline - resampler       (no lookahead -> edge transfers)
    (SECTION D+ added as M2+ land: features, laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry)

HOW THE LLM RISK DOCTOR SHOULD USE THIS FILE
--------------------------------------------
A green master suite means the *substrate* the bot trains on is faithful and fast;
it does NOT by itself prove the policy passes. When triangulating a pass-rate
regression, first confirm this suite is green — a red data/resampler test means the
bot's world is corrupt (e.g. lookahead leakage masquerading as a learned edge), and
that is the break, not the actor/critic. Only if the substrate is sound do you walk
the chain into hidden-state / reward / critic diagnostics.

# UPDATE LOG (IRAC) — standing rule since 2026-06-13.
# Every change APPENDS a dated IRAC entry (newest last). Conclusion is ALWAYS why
# the change makes the bot pass FTMO more consistently with no bug/inefficiency.
# Rulebook: docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] Created the single master suite (hardening pass).
#   I: Tests were split across test_runtime.py + test_data_pipeline.py; the operator
#      wanted ONE runnable suite, and future milestones risked fragmenting tests.
#   R: New standing rule — one master suite all future tests append to; every guard
#      framed against repeated FTMO passing (SOW Section 11 acceptance tests).
#   A: Consolidated all runtime + data-pipeline tests here under chain-ordered
#      sections (A runtime, B loader, C resampler); added efficiency/caching guards
#      (parquet-cache reuse, parse throughput); deleted the two old test files.
#   C: A single green command now proves the training substrate is faithful and
#      cheap, so we can afford the seeds/windows that establish a reproducible pass
#      rate — and the LLM can rule the substrate out first when triangulating.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section D - feature builder + state vector (M2).
#   I: The ~145-scalar observation needed proof it is complete (146), bounded,
#      signal-bearing, and lookahead-free before any policy trains on it.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md schema (146) + lookahead-safety + bounded-encoding design.
#   A: Added Section D - schema/block-width pins, config==schema, finite+clipped
#      matrix, signal-variance, truncated-vs-full no-lookahead, cyclical time,
#      assemble_state width+validation, valid_from warmup. 8 tests (23 total green).
#   C: The bot's world is now provably faithful and leak-free, so a learned edge is
#      real and transfers live - the precondition for repeatable FTMO passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section E - change-impact tracker + raw-input block tests.
#   I: An operator-added raw SMA/CCI block changed the observation (146->176); the
#      obs could later drift again undetected and silently degrade pass-rate.
#   R: Operator directives (raw inputs + a change-impact tracking system, LLM-readable).
#   A: Updated Section D to 176/raw-block coverage; added Section E - snapshot-match,
#      LLM-interpretation, AST dependency-graph, and FTMO-framed-report tests.
#   C: The observation is now both faithful AND change-guarded, so any future obs
#      change is caught with a concrete follow-up list before it can hurt passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section F - LawMask (M3) + gate ingredients (dim 176->179).
#   I: The bot needed its spine (which directions are legal) proven correct before
#      training, and the snapshot needed re-pinning after adding gate ingredients.
#   R: THE_TRADING_CODE.md (9 laws + 3 gates, exact params) + SOW C5 (-1e9) + §2.3-2.4
#      position/slot legality + the two enforcement modes.
#   A: Section F - law states per family (incl. CCI +100, ssma align, pullback desync),
#      3 gates, position/slot legality, live-ban vs school-permission, pointer mask,
#      end-to-end wrapper. Re-pinned the state-vector snapshot to 179.
#   C: The legal space is verified exactly per blueprint, so the mask mechanically
#      blocks breach-bound directions in both training and live - the foundation of
#      not breaching, which is the foundation of consistent passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section G - Env + RiskManager + CostLayer (M4).
#   I: The challenge physics (shared account, 5 slots, true-sequential risk, costs,
#      wall) needed proof that no risk/sizing rule can overshoot and that the loop is
#      faithful, before any policy trains on it.
#   R: SOW B5 (no collective overshoot) + H3 (sizing vs buffer) + §10.5 (costs) +
#      §2.4 (slots) + §2.7 (wall).
#   A: Section G - CostLayer (forex-only $5 RT, spread/slippage), RiskManager
#      no-overshoot (2000-case fuzz + refusal), B5 4-symbol one-bar invariant,
#      true-sequential buffer visibility, slot fill/mask/pointer-close, round-trip cost
#      bleed, hard-wall force-flatten, 179-dim obs + mask coercion. 12 tests.
#   C: The env is now provably faithful and overshoot-proof, so the behaviour the bot
#      learns here is the behaviour that passes real challenges - not a sim artifact.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section H - PPOAgent + RolloutBuffer + PPO loss (M5).
#   I: The brain that consumes the 179-dim obs and emits masked, sized, slot-aware
#      actions - plus the summed-log-prob PPO loss - needed building + proving.
#   R: PPO_ENGINE.md (3x256 trunk, 4 heads, Beta size, summed 3-head log-prob,
#      size-on-OPEN/pointer-on-CLOSE gating, -1e9 masks, live argmax/mean) + SOW §2.8/2.9.
#   A: Section H - locked architecture shape, mask-respecting sampling, the OPEN/CLOSE
#      log-prob gating, deterministic argmax/Beta-mean, 10-field buffer + no-replay,
#      PPO loss (ratio≈1/KL≈0 post-collection, grad reaches the trunk), agent-drives-env.
#   C: The policy provably cannot sample an illegal/breach-bound action and its update
#      is a correct trust-region step - so training under the M4 physics moves it toward
#      passing, not toward the wall.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section I - RewardEngine + QUAD + E8 (M6).
#   I: The objective needed Layer-0 dominance proven, plus the pain ramp and QUAD ceiling.
#   R: REWARD_DESIGN.md + E8 (L0 dominates) + E9 (QUAD 95% ceiling, pass-day gate).
#   A: Section I - E8 dominance over 1000 rollouts, pain-zone monotonicity, L0 whisper,
#      QUAD 95% ceiling + non-pass-day zero + streak reset, env-uses-engine. 6 tests.
#   C: The training signal provably can't be hijacked by a shaper, so PPO optimizes real
#      net progress inside the legal/risk-safe space - the objective that passes.
