"""QUANTRA MASTER TEST SUITE — the one big runnable test for the whole folder.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (read before adding tests)
-----------------------------------------------
STANDING RULE [2026-06-13]: this is the SINGLE place every Quantra test lives.
All future tests — for any milestone (laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry, ...) —
are APPENDED here under the matching section, never scattered into new files. One
command runs the entire folder's guarantees:

    pytest tests/test_ftmo_master_suite.py        # or just: pytest

WHAT IT PROVES (everything is judged against repeated FTMO passing, not PnL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The suite is organised along the interpretability chain from
``docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md`` (State Vector -> Law -> Hidden State ->
Heads -> Risk -> Reward -> Outcome), plus the cost/speed substrate that lets us
afford enough seeds and walk-forward windows to *establish* a pass rate:

    SECTION A  Runtime / hardware efficiency   (afford the validation budget)
    SECTION B  Data pipeline - loader          (faithful FTMO situation in)
    SECTION C  Data pipeline - resampler       (no lookahead -> edge transfers)
    (SECTION D+ added as M2+ land: features, laws, env, agent, reward, telemetry)

HOW THE LLM RISK DOCTOR SHOULD USE THIS FILE
--------------------------------------------
A green master suite means the *substrate* the bot trains on is faithful and fast;
it does NOT by itself prove the policy passes. When triangulating a pass-rate
regression, first confirm this suite is green — a red data/resampler test means the
bot's world is corrupt (e.g. lookahead leakage masquerading as a learned edge), and
that is the break, not the actor/critic. Only if the substrate is sound do you walk
the chain into hidden-state / reward / critic diagnostics.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# UPDATE LOG (IRAC) — standing rule since 2026-06-13.
# Every change APPENDS a dated IRAC entry (newest last). Conclusion is ALWAYS why
# the change makes the bot pass FTMO more consistently with no bug/inefficiency.
# Rulebook: docs/MLP_INTERPRETABILITY_LAYER.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# [2026-06-13] Created the single master suite (hardening pass).
#   I: Tests were split across test_runtime.py + test_data_pipeline.py; the operator
#      wanted ONE runnable suite, and future milestones risked fragmenting tests.
#   R: New standing rule — one master suite all future tests append to; every guard
#      framed against repeated FTMO passing (SOW Section 11 acceptance tests).
#   A: Consolidated all runtime + data-pipeline tests here under chain-ordered
#      sections (A runtime, B loader, C resampler); added efficiency/caching guards
#      (parquet-cache reuse, parse throughput); deleted the two old test files.
#   C: A single green command now proves the training substrate is faithful and
#      cheap, so we can afford the seeds/windows that establish a reproducible pass
#      rate — and the LLM can rule the substrate out first when triangulating.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section D - feature builder + state vector (M2).
#   I: The ~145-scalar observation needed proof it is complete (146), bounded,
#      signal-bearing, and lookahead-free before any policy trains on it.
#   R: STATE_VECTOR.md schema (146) + lookahead-safety + bounded-encoding design.
#   A: Added Section D - schema/block-width pins, config==schema, finite+clipped
#      matrix, signal-variance, truncated-vs-full no-lookahead, cyclical time,
#      assemble_state width+validation, valid_from warmup. 8 tests (23 total green).
#   C: The bot's world is now provably faithful and leak-free, so a learned edge is
#      real and transfers live - the precondition for repeatable FTMO passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section E - change-impact tracker + raw-input block tests.
#   I: An operator-added raw SMA/CCI block changed the observation (146->176); the
#      obs could later drift again undetected and silently degrade pass-rate.
#   R: Operator directives (raw inputs + a change-impact tracking system, LLM-readable).
#   A: Updated Section D to 176/raw-block coverage; added Section E - snapshot-match,
#      LLM-interpretation, AST dependency-graph, and FTMO-framed-report tests.
#   C: The observation is now both faithful AND change-guarded, so any future obs
#      change is caught with a concrete follow-up list before it can hurt passing.
# [2026-06-13] Added Section F - LawMask (M3) + gate ingredients (dim 176->179).
#   I: The bot needed its spine (which directions are legal) proven correct before
#      training, and the snapshot needed re-pinning after adding gate ingredients.
#   R: THE_TRADING_CODE.md (9 laws + 3 gates, exact params) + SOW C5 (-1e9) + §2.3-2.4
#      position/slot legality + the two enforcement modes.
#   A: Section F - law states per family (incl. CCI +100, ssma align, pullback desync),
#      3 gates, position/slot legality, live-ban vs school-permission, pointer mask,
#      end-to-end wrapper. Re-pinned the state-vector snapshot to 179.
#   C: The legal space is verified exactly per blueprint, so the mask mechanically
#      blocks breach-bound directions in both training and live - the foundation of
#      not breaching, which is the foundation of consistent passing.
